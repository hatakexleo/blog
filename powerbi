import data into powerbi.
how to build a model.
how you can share report with others.

download powerbi desktop in windows

go to main report view -> opens when you just open power bi.

in home-> getdata -> <select_data>

select the file.

this opens a navigator tab which we will use to get data to powerbi efficiently,

-> we will take the tables from the box.
-> we can transform before bringing it into powerbi
-> or we can just use load.

at the right side at the data box we will get the all the information of data 
that is being loded.

now we can try any refinements to the data.
some of the examples are below:



left side of the work space (in the middle left) there are 3 options 
and second one is data view click on that.
-> we can see all the data available in the imported tables.
-> we select which table to see on the left.


in the example we saw in tutorial by kevin stratvert power bi tutorial in 10 
we have.

united stated as it is and at some places we have us instead.
this is a problem so we will now solve it.


to do so we will have to go back to the report view.
and in the top ribbon we have.

->home->queries->trasformdata.

it will open powerquery editor.

doing something in powerquery editor will not effect our data in local machine.
it acts as middle layer between data and your work.

now in power query editor we get to see the available tables at the left hand side.


we can now see the country column with inconsistent references.

now right click on the column header and we can get a bunch of options.
what we want to do now is replace values.
click on it.


we will fill what to be replaced by what.
