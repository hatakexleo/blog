import data into powerbi.
how to build a model.
how you can share report with others.

download powerbi desktop in windows

go to main report view -> opens when you just open power bi.

in home-> getdata -> <select_data>

select the file.

this opens a navigator tab which we will use to get data to powerbi efficiently,

-> we will take the tables from the box.
-> we can transform before bringing it into powerbi
-> or we can ust use load.

at the right side at the data box we will get the all the information of data 
that is being loded.

now we can try any refinements to the data.
some of the examples are below:



left side of the work space (in the middle left) there are 3 options 
and second one is data view click on that.
-> we can see all the data available in the imported tables.
-> we select which table to see on the left.
